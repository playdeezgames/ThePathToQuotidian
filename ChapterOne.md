# Scene I

Runt of the Tribe, for such was his designator and served approximately the same purpose as a name in human society, continued to run as quickly as he could down the tunnel. His heart beat rapidly and felt ready to give out at any time. The wounds on his leg and tail still bled, matting down his feathers, but he dared not stop, for the Enemies pursued him to finish their job of killing him and feast on his flesh. Ahead of him, he saw a light, and he pushed his aching muscles to go even faster. He burst into the bright noonday sunlight and kept running. He squinted as his eyes adjusted to the bright exterior lights, attempting to figure out where in the Bog he was. But he was not in the Bog, it seemed, or at least, not in any part of the Bog that he was familiar with. The air was drier here, the land firmer and covered in grass. Nearby he spotted a hedge that he could hide in. He quickly turned his head to glance back at the tunnel he had exited. His pursuers had not emerged. That was a stroke of luck.

He sprinted to the hedge and crouched low to the ground, continuing to fiercely watch for his Enemies, but allowing his body to rest, to breathe. The Enemy still did not emerge, so Runt of Tribe waited. His heart calmed, as did his breathing. Maybe they had gotten lost? *That’s impossible*, thought Runt, *The tunnel is completely straight, with no turns or twists or branches.* He waited patiently, but eventually his leg and tail wounds pained him enough to take his attention away from the tunnel’s entrance.

He licked his wounds with his forked tongue, still momentarily glancing back to where he expected the Enemies to show up at any moment. The coppery taste of the blood reminded him that he still had not managed to eat today, though he was glad that he had not yet become someone else’s meal. At least, not yet. A few moments later, his wounds were cleaned. None of them were life threatening, and his various scars, though hidden under his feathers, bore testimony to the fact that he had suffered worse before. Eventually his exhaustion got the better of him, and he fell unconscious.

He awoke with a start. The sun had moved. He had not meant to sleep at all. Still hidden in the bush, he checked the area. Had the enemy found him, they would have killed and eaten him, so they had forgotten him or found something else to hunt. Runt did not care, because he lived still. But he was still hungry, and now even more ravenously. His flight had depleted his energy reserves, and he would need to eat soon or be in real trouble. Still not willing to depart from his safe hiding spot, he looked between the leaves and branches at the region around him, and was immediately reminded that he was no longer in the Bog, where he might have easily found puddles filled with Prey.

He cocked his head to the side, listening intently for tell tale signs of Prey, in whatever form it might be here. He could not afford to be picky today. Within moments, he heard birdsong, and that singer of that song landed on the grass near his hiding place, foraging for bugs and worms.

*Prey!* he thought. He tensed his muscles, readying for a pounce. But before he could do so, the bird, with a fat earthworm in its beak, jumped up and flew towards a nearby wooded area. While disappointed that his meal was delayed, Runt knew that this meant something important: this bird had a nest nearby, and that nest had  fledgling in it - a nice juicy fledgeling.

He got onto his three toed-feet quietly, always on the alert for danger. He quickly ran into the wooded area he had seen the bird fly into. Finding another stealthy hiding spot, he listened some more. His mouth salivated at the thought of tearing open the fledgeling with his fangs and passing it mostly whole into his gullet. That would be a mighty fine meal indeed. But for now, he listened and waited. His patience, he was certain, would be rewarded.

The wait felt like forever, though it was only a few moments, and he heard a rustle up a nearby tree. He scanned the high branches with his keen eyes. The nest was there, but so was the mother. He would have to wait until she left before proceeding. Another subjective eternity later, she departed, and he sprang into action. Most of Runt's kind made very poor climbers, but that was mostly due to the fact that they were usually at least half again as big as him, but also they were unpractised. Most of Tribe did not need to climb trees to get food, because it was plentiful enough in Bog to not need to see up high. Runt had occasionally used his climbing ability to find food, but he more often used to to avoid becoming food.  He numbling dug his forearm and foot claws into the bark of the tree and shimmed up quickly, but quietly, to the level of the nest. As expected, the fledgling was there. Correction, there were two fledglings. He wanted to know which of them were more delicious, and planned to find out.

Suddenly he heard a screeching sound, and before he could turn to look for its origin, the mother bird had attacked his head, leaving a scratch near his eye. Now he could see his attacker, and he saw that it was not the mother bird. This bird had brighter plumage and was bigger. The father, then. He had picked a type of bird where both parents participated in the raising of their young.  Momentarily, another screech as the mother had been alerted and returned to the nest area, and he fended them off as best he could, but it was clear that the fledgelings would not be on the menu this afternoon. The parent birds did not stop pestering him until he had put a safe distance between himself and the tree. 

He backed away slowly, longingly looking back to the tree holding a delicious meal that he was being denied. His hunger burned more fiercely in his belly. He was getting desperate. He stumbled backwards and found himself having fallen across a small stream. It was only ankle deep, and not so wide that he could not jump over it with a short run. But streams meant fish, and fish meant food, so Runt found his way upstream to where the water flowed more slowly and shallowly, and stood over the water, waiting for fish to wander by unaware.

Fish did come, of course, but they were both too fast and too small for him to catch. He caught a few morsels, and gobbled their meagre offering greedily. They were no fat fledglings, but he could not be choosy at this point.

As the shadows were getting long as the sun set, he finally allowed practicality to enter into his food solutions. As a whole, he did not care for worms and grubs, but it was not the first time he had need of making use of this food resource in his life, and he figured it woult unlikely be his last if his luck did not change. He found several rocks and fallen logs to look under, and made a modest wriggling meal of the slimy, squishy creatures he found beneath it. At least he wouldn't starve, but tonight he would not sleep with a full belly, either.

The sun was getting low, and he had shelter to consider. He briefly thought about the tunnel he had run through, but discarded the idea immediately. He had not revisited that area since entering the woods. The Enemies might have finally arrived, or be lurking within. He also rejected the idea of spending the night in a tree, lest any other birds find him an intruder and attack him. He set out desperately looking for a place in which to sleep. It was getting dark.

Fortunately, he soon found a dying tree with a hollow in its trunk large enough for him to squeeze into. Wisely, he first picked up a long stick to poke into it in order to check if this tree already had a resident. To his relieve it did not. He slid into the hollow, scratching out some of the interior to shove against the inlet to his cozy space. It was not comfortable, but in the morning he would find something to pad the inside.

In the darkness, with the unfamiliar night insects buzzing their song, and hungry and cold Runt slept in the hollow of the tree, safe for the moment. He had lived another day. But would he survive tomorrow?

# Scene II

The prisoner, whose name was Leutfrid Oakbottom, was bound and gagged withing a prisoner cart. He was a Tlakkan, and like most of his kind stood, when such standing was possible, just shy of three and a half feet tall. His hair, on both head and feet, was an unremarkable curly brown, and his eyes was a nondescript brown. He was, in short, not very threatening to behold, and one would wonder why he needed to be imprisoned in this precise fashion.

The driver of the cart's name was Leubast Silverstring, a Tlakkan ranger. She was just over three feet, with, long brown hair tied back in a pony tail and green eyes. Pretty for a Tlakkan, but with a ferocity to her face that made even the most bravely amorous Tlakkan men think twice before approaching. She was a bounty hunter by trade, and turning in  this bounty would afford her and upgrade in equipment, especially a new pony to replace Treasure, who was old and long overdue for retirement.

Once more in desperation, Leutfrid twisted his bonds and attempted to free his mouth from the gag. He flailed about until his wrists hurt and his hair damp with sweat, to no avail. The knots were too expertly tied. There would be no escape for him.

"You ought to save your strength for yer tribunal," Leubast taunted, smiling lightly to herself. She had tied those expert knots. She was a bounty hunter who knew her business, and for a bounty with this high of a reward, she had triple checked her work.

His tribunal. Leutfrid dreaded it. Tlakkans were for the most part merciful and lenient about most crimes, but certain heinous crimes were still met with traditional, brutal punishment. Such was his crime, for Leutfrid was a Voidmage - colloquially a necromancer. It was a very rare thing for a Tlakkan to have any magical talents at all, and when they did, it was almost always that of an Airmage, an Earthmage, or a Lightmage. No Voidmages had appeared in recent Tlakkan history, until Leutfrid.

Leubast pulled on the reigns to make Izzy stop. Leutfrid protested with a muffled yell as he hit his head against the front of the cage. "Quiet," she hissed at her captive. He was quiet.

She counted four men standing across the path blocking her way. He peripheral vision caught a fifth skulking about in the brush. She moved her hand slowly to loosen the shortsword at her hip. The men were dirty, and all of average human height except for one. She figured him to be the leader. They all held clubs and staves. This was an isolated area in the road, in between two hills. No other traffic around. 

Reaching into her vest, she pulled out a scroll with the details of her bounty. "I demand that you let me pass," she said with a forced confidence, "I am on official business for the Confederacy of Tlak, and they will take a dim view of your causing me delay."

The four men looked at each other and chuckled. Then the biggest one, now confirmed to be the leader, gave and exaggerated and mocking bow. "Pardon us poor peasants, m'lady," his tone dripped with contempt as he straightened, "we have no intention on keeping you from your official business." But they did not move, and she glowered at them.

The leader continued, "We request only a small donation, a trifle really, for we have fallen upon hard times. Our families don't have enough to eat, with all of the Ralatlan refugees in the area. Food has become very expensive. You wouldn't want us to starve to death, would you?" All this while, the others were gripping their weapons nervously, shifting their weights back and forth on their legs. Leubast knew they were readying to attack, no matter how big her "donation" was. 

Leubast jumped to her feet atop of the cart and drew her shortsword, holding it at the ready. "Not a penny for a group of pathetic bandits like you!" she bellowed. They had angered her, and they were disorganized and untrained. She hoped that if she managed to wound the leader, the rest would run off. It was a risk, but she saw no other choice. Besides, if they freed the captive, or even ungagged him... she hated to consider the consequences.

Her boldness caught all but the leader off guard. She figured that most of their victims simply gave them whatever they wanted, but Leubast took her duty seriously. She would bring in the bounty, or die trying.

"You decided to make it fun for me, then," sneered the leader. He seemed a sadistic brute, the perfect front man for this bandit troupe. He strode up to the pony and smacked Izzy on her rear with his club.

Izzy did as ponies do when faced with the unexpected. She spooked and started to run. Leubast found herself off balance and toppled to the ground. Quickly, she got back to her feet to square off against the leader, who was shouting, "After the cart, lads! I'll have a little dance with this little one." 

The other three ran off after the cart. The leader eyed her up, switching grips on his club. He was waiting for something, she thought. Then he looked past her shoulder, and too late she remembered the fifth bandit. Before she could turn, something hard hit her in the side of the head, and she was knocked out.
