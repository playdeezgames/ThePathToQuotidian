Runt of the Tribe, for such was his designator and served approximately the same purpose as a name in human society, continued to run as quickly as he could down the tunnel. His heart beat rapidly and felt ready to give out at any time. The wounds on his leg and tail still bled, matting down his feathers, but he dared not stop, for the Enemies pursued him to finish their job of killing him and feast on his flesh. Ahead of him, he saw a light, and he pushed his aching muscles to go even faster. He burst into the bright noonday sunlight and kept running. He squinted as his eyes adjusted to the bright exterior lights, attempting to figure out where in the Bog he was. But he was not in the Bog, it seemed, or at least, not in any part of the Bog that he was familiar with. The air was drier here, the land firmer and covered in grass. Nearby he spotted a hedge that he could hide in. He quickly turned his head to glance back at the tunnel he had exited. His pursuers had not emerged. That was a stroke of luck.

He sprinted to the hedge and crouched low to the ground, continuing to fiercely watch for his Enemies, but allowing his body to rest, to breathe. The Enemy still did not emerge, so Runt of Tribe waited. His heart calmed, as did his breathing. Maybe they had gotten lost? *That’s impossible*, thought Runt, *The tunnel is completely straight, with no turns or twists or branches.* He waited patiently, but eventually his leg and tail wounds pained him enough to take his attention away from the tunnel’s entrance.

He licked his wounds with his forked tongue, still momentarily glancing back to where he expected the Enemies to show up at any moment. The coppery taste of the blood reminded him that he still had not managed to eat today, though he was glad that he had not yet become someone else’s meal. At least, not yet. A few moments later, his wounds were cleaned. None of them were life threatening, and his various scars, though hidden under his feathers, bore testimony to the fact that he had suffered worse before. Eventually his exhaustion got the better of him, and he fell unconscious.

He awoke with a start. The sun had moved. He had not meant to sleep at all. Still hidden in the bush, he checked the area. Had the enemy found him, they would have killed and eaten him, so they had forgotten him or found something else to hunt. Runt did not care, because he lived still. But he was still hungry, and now even more ravenously. His flight had depleted his energy reserves, and he would need to eat soon or be in real trouble. Still not willing to depart from his safe hiding spot, he looked between the leaves and branches at the region around him, and was immediately reminded that he was no longer in the Bog, where he might have easily found puddles filled with Prey.

He cocked his head to the side, listening intently for tell tale signs of Prey, in whatever form it might be here. He could not afford to be picky today. Within moments, he heard birdsong, and that singer of that song landed on the grass near his hiding place, foraging for bugs and worms.

*Prey!* he thought. He tensed his muscles, readying for a pounce. But before he could do so, the bird, with a fat earthworm in its beak, jumped up and flew towards a nearby wooded area. While disappointed that his meal was delayed, Runt knew that this meant something important: this bird had a nest nearby, and that nest had  fledgling in it - a nice juicy fledgeling.

He got onto his three toed-feet quietly, always on the alert for danger. He quickly ran into the wooded area he had seen the bird fly into. Finding another stealthy hiding spot, he listened some more. His mouth salivated at the thought of tearing open the fledgeling with his fangs and passing it mostly whole into his gullet. That would be a mighty fine meal indeed. But for now, he listened and waited. His patience, he was certain, would be rewarded.

The wait felt like forever, though it was only a few moments, and he heard a rustle up a nearby tree. He scanned the high branches with his keen eyes. The nest was there, but so was the mother. He would have to wait until she left before proceeding. Another subjective eternity later, she departed, and he sprang into action. Most of Runt's kind made very poor climbers, but that was mostly due to the fact that they were usually at least half again as big as him, but also they were unpractised. Most of Tribe did not need to climb trees to get food, because it was plentiful enough in Bog to not need to see up high. Runt had occasionally used his climbing ability to find food, but he more often used to to avoid becoming food.  He numbling dug his forearm and foot claws into the bark of the tree and shimmed up quickly, but quietly, to the level of the nest. As expected, the fledgling was there. Correction, there were two fledglings. He wanted to know which of them were more delicious, and planned to find out.

Suddenly he heard a screeching sound, and before he could turn to look for its origin, the mother bird had attacked his head, leaving a scratch near his eye. Now he could see his attacker, and he saw that it was not the mother bird. This bird had brighter plumage and was bigger. The father, then. He had picked a type of bird where both parents participated in the raising of their young.  Momentarily, another screech as the mother had been alerted and returned to the nest area, and he fended them off as best he could, but it was clear that the fledgelings would not be on the menu this afternoon. The parent birds did not stop pestering him until he had put a safe distance between himself and the tree. 

He backed away slowly, longingly looking back to the tree holding a delicious meal that he was being denied. His hunger burned more fiercely in his belly. He was getting desperate. He stumbled backwards and found himself having fallen across a small stream. It was only ankle deep, and not so wide that he could not jump over it with a short run. But streams meant fish, and fish meant food, so Runt found his way upstream to where the water flowed more slowly and shallowly, and stood over the water, waiting for fish to wander by unaware.

Fish did come, of course, but they were both too fast and too small for him to catch. He caught a few morsels, and gobbled their meagre offering greedily. They were no fat fledglings, but he could not be choosy at this point.

As the shadows were getting long as the sun set, he finally allowed practicality to enter into his food solutions. As a whole, he did not care for worms and grubs, but it was not the first time he had need of making use of this food resource in his life, and he figured it woult unlikely be his last if his luck did not change. He found several rocks and fallen logs to look under, and made a modest wriggling meal of the slimy, squishy creatures he found beneath it. At least he wouldn't starve, but tonight he would not sleep with a full belly, either.

The sun was getting low, and he had shelter to consider. He briefly thought about the tunnel he had run through, but discarded the idea immediately. He had not revisited that area since entering the woods. The Enemies might have finally arrived, or be lurking within. He also rejected the idea of spending the night in a tree, lest any other birds find him an intruder and attack him. He set out desperately looking for a place in which to sleep. It was getting dark.

Fortunately, he soon found a dying tree with a hollow in its trunk large enough for him to squeeze into. Wisely, he first picked up a long stick to poke into it in order to check if this tree already had a resident. To his relieve it did not. He slid into the hollow, scratching out some of the interior to shove against the inlet to his cozy space. It was not comfortable, but in the morning he would find something to pad the inside.

In the darkness, with the unfamiliar night insects buzzing their song, and hungry and cold Runt slept in the hollow of the tree, safe for the moment. He had lived another day. But would he survive tomorrow?

* * *

The prisoner, whose name was Leutfrid Oakbottom, was bound and gagged withing a prisoner cart. He was a Tlakkan, and like most of his kind stood, when such standing was possible, just shy of three and a half feet tall. His hair, on both head and feet, was an unremarkable curly brown, and his eyes was a nondescript brown. He was, in short, not very threatening to behold, and one would wonder why he needed to be imprisoned in this precise fashion.

The driver of the cart's name was Leubast Silverstring, a Tlakkan ranger. She was just over three feet, with, long brown hair tied back in a pony tail and green eyes. Pretty for a Tlakkan, but with a ferocity to her face that made even the most bravely amorous Tlakkan men think twice before approaching. She was a bounty hunter by trade, and turning in  this bounty would afford her and upgrade in equipment, especially a new pony to replace Treasure, who was old and long overdue for retirement.

Once more in desperation, Leutfrid twisted his bonds and attempted to free his mouth from the gag. He flailed about until his wrists hurt and his hair damp with sweat, to no avail. The knots were too expertly tied. There would be no escape for him.

"You ought to save your strength for yer tribunal," Leubast taunted, smiling lightly to herself. She had tied those expert knots. She was a bounty hunter who knew her business, and for a bounty with this high of a reward, she had triple checked her work.

His tribunal. Leutfrid dreaded it. Tlakkans were for the most part merciful and lenient about most crimes, but certain heinous crimes were still met with traditional, brutal punishment. Such was his crime, for Leutfrid was a Voidmage - colloquially a necromancer. It was a very rare thing for a Tlakkan to have any magical talents at all, and when they did, it was almost always that of an Airmage, an Earthmage, or a Lightmage. No Voidmages had appeared in recent Tlakkan history, until Leutfrid.

Leubast pulled on the reigns to make Izzy stop. Leutfrid protested with a muffled yell as he hit his head against the front of the cage. "Quiet," she hissed at her captive. He was quiet.

She counted four men standing across the path blocking her way. He peripheral vision caught a fifth skulking about in the brush. She moved her hand slowly to loosen the shortsword at her hip. The men were dirty, and all of average human height except for one. She figured him to be the leader. They all held clubs and staves. This was an isolated area in the road, in between two hills. No other traffic around. 

Reaching into her vest, she pulled out a scroll with the details of her bounty. "I demand that you let me pass," she said with a forced confidence, "I am on official business for the Confederacy of Tlak, and they will take a dim view of your causing me delay."

The four men looked at each other and chuckled. Then the biggest one, now confirmed to be the leader, gave and exaggerated and mocking bow. "Pardon us poor peasants, m'lady," his tone dripped with contempt as he straightened, "we have no intention on keeping you from your official business." But they did not move, and she glowered at them.

The leader continued, "We request only a small donation, a trifle really, for we have fallen upon hard times. Our families don't have enough to eat, with all of the Ralatlan refugees in the area. Food has become very expensive. You wouldn't want us to starve to death, would you?" All this while, the others were gripping their weapons nervously, shifting their weights back and forth on their legs. Leubast knew they were readying to attack, no matter how big her "donation" was. 

Leubast jumped to her feet atop of the cart and drew her shortsword, holding it at the ready. "Not a penny for a group of pathetic bandits like you!" she bellowed. They had angered her, and they were disorganized and untrained. She hoped that if she managed to wound the leader, the rest would run off. It was a risk, but she saw no other choice. Besides, if they freed the captive, or even ungagged him... she hated to consider the consequences.

Her boldness caught all but the leader off guard. She figured that most of their victims simply gave them whatever they wanted, but Leubast took her duty seriously. She would bring in the bounty, or die trying.

"You decided to make it fun for me, then," sneered the leader. He seemed a sadistic brute, the perfect front man for this bandit troupe. He strode up to the pony and smacked Izzy on her rear with his club.

Izzy did as ponies do when faced with the unexpected. She spooked and started to run. Leubast found herself off balance and toppled to the ground. Quickly, she got back to her feet to square off against the leader, who was shouting, "After the cart, lads! I'll have a little dance with this little one." 

The other three ran off after the cart. The leader eyed her up, switching grips on his club. He was waiting for something, she thought. Then he looked past her shoulder, and too late she remembered the fifth bandit. Before she could turn, something hard hit her in the side of the head, and she was knocked out.

Meanwhile, Leutfrid was getting battered and bruised on the uneven road as it careened out of control without a driver and a panicking pony. The cart wheel did not take long to find a large rock at the side of the road to tip it over in a noisy crash that knocked the wind out of Leutfrid's lungs.

Stunned and gasping for air, he struggled to sit up. The cage was on its side, and the hinges holding on the door in the back were broken. He could get out! Immediately he tried to stand, then remembered that his feet were bound as well as his hands. He could hear the bandits approaching, and knew that he didn't have much time before they would find him.

He wormed his way to the back of the cage. A jagged piece of metal was in the frame of where the cage door had been. He attempted to lift his legs high enough to use the edge to cut his bonds, but alas, he just could not reach.

The bandits were within view. In a moment, his window for escape and freedom would close permanently. He considered his options. On one hand, he had no guarantee that the bandits would not kill him, but on the other hand, he was heading towards a tribunal that would have burned him at the stake.

He decided, instead, to play dead. He lay still and quiet, barely daring more than a shallow breath. He doubted it would work, but forced his mind to remain calm as the bandits arrived and ransacked the cart. Mostly they concentrated on the pony and Leubast's strongboxes.

Once they had looted the front of the cart, they made their way to the back. "What about him?" one of them asked. "I think he's dead." said the other, poking Leutfrid with a stick. He managed not to react. "What to do with a dead Tlakkan?" asked the third.

They were not a sophisticated lot, but they knew better than to leave evidence of their crime on the side of the road. From their conversation, Leutfrid came to know that one of the wagon wheels was broken, so the cart was mostly a loss. They righted it so that the three wheels could be used, and Leutfrid nearly let out a sound as he was thrown from the side to the floor of the cage again. They then pushed the cart back into the brush to conceal it from a passer by, and cut a few branches to further conceal it.

Then the bandits departed. His trick had worked, but they might come back. He waited long, agonizing minutes to be certain that they had gone for good before reassessing his situation. From the current orientation of the cage, he could reach the jagged edge, and he did so, unbinding his hands. The rope was stout and well tied. Leubast had known her business! But eventually he got the job done, and was able to remove his gag.

Moving his hands and uttering a small enchantment caused his foot bindings to dissolve by rotting away. The fibers were once living plants, and so responded to his death magic almost immediately. So he was free, but he needed to put distance between him and any potential pursuers.

Circulation had been somewhat cut off from his hands and feet, so they were somewhat numb, but he forced himself to exit the cart, plopping into an undignified heap on the ground. He got to his feet despite soreness, numbness, and pain. He had to get moving. He limped quickly into the woods, and did not stop until he was deep in the earthy, damp darkness provided by the shade of the taller trees.

He was free for now, but his freedom would do him no good if he starved to death. He needed shelter, water, and food, in that order. To find them, he would need help.

He picked his way through the dense trees, looking for a suitable dead animal to become his thrall. He hoped he could find a mostly intact specimen, but he would do with a three legged rabbit with both ears and one eye chewed out if he could find one.

Within short order, he happened upon a dead bird. Its neck was broken by another animal, and had not lain there for more than a few hours. In the ground around it, there were tracks of two animals, though he knew not which. Apparently one animal had hunted the bird, but the next animal was hunting the hunter. In either case, he was grateful that the bird was in good shape and not torn to pieces.

He held it in his hands, uttering the phrases that would bring the animal back to a semblance of life and link his senses to its senses. The bird stood up, now undead and subject to the bidding of Leutfrid. 

He closed his eyes and concentrated, willing the bird to fly up above the trees and scout the area. The bird flapped uselessly and fell to the ground. He picked it up and tried again, concentrating harder. The bird flew straight into the trunk of a large tree and tumbled to the ground again.

Frustrated, but knowing that stress would interfere with his link and control, he sat down and concentrating on breathing in a controlled manner. After a few more falters, he could command the bird to flap up to a higher branch. He would have to take the ability to do large jumps of this kind until he could gain the mastery necessary, if ever he did. Remote controlling the undead was difficult, especially one with a mode of travel so drastically different than his own.

Within a few hours, using a kind of telepathy with his undead creation, he had located some acorns and other nuts to eat. He opened them with a couple of stones and ate them without roasting. They were not delicious, but he had been malnourished before the episode with the bandits, and using voidmagic was fatiguing, so he needed the energy desperately.

As night fell, he found a few trees grown closely together that he could squeeze between and cover himself with leaves for the night. It would not be comfortable, and he hoped it did not rain, for that would be miserable.  A small creek was nearby and he drank. It was moving water, not stagnant, and he hoped he would avoid illness this way.

Alone in the darkness, he took stock of his situation and options. He could not go east to Tlak, that was certain. He would have to remain in human lands, but there was a war in Ralatlan, the area from which Leubast had been taking him. He smiled lightly to himself. Long term plans would have to wait. It was better to worry about the next few days of just surviving. With that, he managed to fall into a fitful sleep.

* * *

Runt woke to a loud but distant cry of a territorial bird. He was not familiar with the variety, but his stomach told him that it bore investigation. He unblocked the entrance to his tree hole and cocked his head to one side, listening for the sound. The bird made its loud cry again, and he got a good inclination as to the direction. He head in the direction of what he hoped would become his breakfast.

Before too long, he found himself at the edge of the woods, and he could see that there was a strangely organized field. Plants were growing in rows, with empty dirt between them. This was not, to his knowledge, how plants grew by themselves. Plants were savage, choking each other out reaching above for sun and below for water. The way that these plants were arranged suggested intelligence, and intelligence meant danger.

He kept out of easy sight behind the trees and brush, observing the strange phenomenon, hoping to catch a glimpse of what sort of creature might be the organizer. Soon he saw one. It was twice as tall as him, and stood upright, with no tail! It didn't even have feathers to keep warm, but seemed to be mostly wrapped in some sort of covering, except for its hands and face, which were both hideously non-reptilian. The faces were flat, the hands had no claws. How could such a creature fight and hunt?

Almost as an answer to his question, the creature swung a tree branch with something at the end of it, which cause some of the dirt nearby the creature to sunder and fly in several directions. It had weapons to make up for its lack of natural defenses. This was not a thing that the Tribe or Enemies did. These creatures must be very intelligent.  However, the way in which the creature expertly wielded his weapon at the ground gave him food for thought. He decided to consider this later, however, as he heard the loud bird cry again.

He stayed out of sight from the weapon wielding creature. He did not want to feel the sting of the dirt weapon! He skulked along the tree line until he saw something he could scarcely understand. There was a small structure that could have not have occurred randomly. The weapons wielders must have constructed it. It was small and square, and there were a number of fat birds nearby, picking through the grass for insects.  On the top of the structure was a similar looking bird, but with brighter plumage. This was the bird making the loud cry. It must be the male of the species, he decided. The females were non-descript.

There were openings in the structure, and the birds walked into and out of it. The openings had wooden panels that looked like they could slide into place to keep the structure shut.

He concluded that these birds must be kept in the structure by the weapon wielders for a reason, and thought about it a while. His conclusion was eggs. The weapon wielders were egg eaters. This gave him some comfort that he did not have to worry about them hunting him. If they ate plants and eggs, they were not hunters, and therefore not Enemies. He still had to be wary, however, for they were strange to him. He would observe them and learn from them and about them.

But that did not sate his hunger. He considered his options. He could find a way into the structure, and take some of the eggs. There must be many in a structure that size. However, if that is what the weapon wielders ate, they might not be all that happy with him if they caught him. Since the structure could be closed, it might be that way to keep out predators at night. So animals would sometimes snag one of the birds to eat. Should he pretend to be one of the predators, and take one now?

One of the birds wandered closer to his hiding place. They must not have good senses of smell, he thought. Or maybe they did, and his scent just was not classified by their small brains as danger. In any case his Prey wandered within just a few body lengths, and he decided. As quickly as he could, he dashed out, grabbed the bird by the neck, and ran back into the brush. The bird let out a loud protest and fluttered its wings, and that cause the other birds in the area to raise the alarm. He snapped its neck to stop its own protests, but the damage was already done, and coupld of the weapon wielders had taken notice and were heading his way.

He ran further into the woods as the Enemies, as such he could now classify them advanced a short ways after him, weapons in hand. He did not wish to feel a strike from those. A few more Enemies gathered, and a group of several followed his trail. They pointed and shouted to one other. They were well organized.  Eventually he found a tree that he could clamber up and hide in its foliage, observing his pursuers down below without them seeing him, hopefully.

A small bird fluttered nearby, landing on a branch one tree over. It looked at him. He was distracted by this, because something about it did not seem right. The clamor of the weapon wielders focused him again. He needed to avoid them, so there was no need to bother with some strange random bird. One of the enemy pointed to the tree that he was hiding in and shouted something to the others. A different one pointed directly at him. How had they found him so quickly?

Immediately, he knew the answer. Feathers. The bird he had slain had left an irregular but followable trail of feathers as he ran through the brambles. Likely a few of his own feathers had been shed along the way. He knew he was done for.

Suddenly, the strange bird flew at his Enemies, scratching at them with its clawed feet. They swung at it with their weapons, but could not connect. The bird kept harrassing them as Runt watched, amazed. Normally such a bird might defend a nest, but this bird had the deliberate decision making of intelligence. This was a strange place ideed. He almost got so engrossed watching this birds antics that he forgot about his own peril.

Coming to his senses, he leapt to another tree and then to another, and finally left the bedlam of his pursuers well behind him. He had escaped, thanks to his helper, and he had his prize. He would eat well!

For along time, he listened. The pursuit did not follow. He tore into the bird, eating muscle and organ. The skin and bones he was very careful to find a place to bury with rocks. If he was to live, he had to be careful of his new Enemies. Maybe they would hunt him down to kill him and eat him after all.

After a time of waiting, he saw the same strange bird land nearby, watching him again. It did not show any fear of him, and he looked at it intently. He closed to less than a body length, and it did not move away, but kept looking at him. Slowly he circled it, it occasionally turned awkwardly to face him. Runt realized what was off about this bird. While it flew and had feathers, it did not tweet or make any noise of any kind. It did not move with a hopping gait as did other birds. Finally, it had a wound on its neck, but it did not bleed. It should be dead, but was moving.

He knew immediately that this was the work of a great Shaman or Medicine Man. Some of them had the power over death, to bring the slain back to life to do their bidding. Fear washed over him, but he forced himself not to run away. Was it a Shaman of his own kind that controlled this berd? It fought against the weapon wielders, so it was not in league with his Enemies, but that did not make it an Ally.

After a short time, realizing that if the Shaman wanted him dead by curses or sendings, then he would be dead already. Maybe the Shaman would be an Ally. Time would tell. For now he could do nothing about it. The bird flew off and he returned to his hollowed tree for a respite in the hottest part of the day.

In the afternoon, Runt went about the business of hunting more food. The bird had sated his hunger for now, but tomorrow he would need something else, so it was best to look around for tomorrows meal. Along his way, he found a fallen long, thin branch lying on the ground. It reminded him of the weapon wielders, so he picked it up and tried to mimic their motions. His anatomy was not well suited to this purpose, and his natural weapons were still quite formidable, so he soon laid down the idea of emulating his Enemies in this way, but his curiousity had made him at least try.

Night fell, and he was still sufficiently rested, but had not yet found a food source. So he snuck back to the tree line by the boxy bird structure. None of the Enemies were present, but neither were the birds. The structure's entrances were now blocked up. It would be a simple matter to open them, he realized, but did he want to? He was certain the birds would raise the alarm again, and he knew not where the Enemies slept. It could be quite nearby, though he could not smell them.

What he could smell was some meat, and it was nearby. He did not generally care for carrion, but this was not a time to be picky. He tracked its position by smell. It came from a strange device made of large branches and some sort of cordage. One branch was pointed upwards and outwards, and the other was flat near the ground. Two shorter, thicker branches flanked it. The meat was in the corner where the two long branches met. He found it fascinating. Why did they build this? Why did they build anything? He examined it closely, careful not to touch it.

Eventually, he figured out how it worked. The branch extending outward and upward could be triggered by something trying to get to the meat, and it would swing down on whatever part of their body they were using to get at it, which was probably the head. It was a automatic killing tool. He wondered if he could build one. He could, he reasoned, but he did not know how to make the cordage. He could plainly see how the mechanism went together.

Having learned all he could from the device, he explored the rest of the area, looking for other Enemy weapons. He found other bits of meat left out, circled by loops of cordage, which he examines. The loops were easily avoided and he grabbed the meat chunks and put them in his gizzard, but out of curiousity he picked one up, and found that in addition to the loop there was a section of cordage tied to a small piece of branch that had one end pressed into the ground to hold it steady. And he understood this mechanism as well. An animal takes the meat, and when they try to leave the loop tightens on the foot or the leg or wherever, and the animal panicks and tries to run, which makes things worse. Either way, the animal would be dead or caught.

In any case, Runt was delighted with this discovery, and dug up two of the sticks holding the loops, and retreated back to his tree hollow, but before retiring for the rest of the night, he set up the loops in places where he had seen animals running to and fro. With any luck, one of them might be stupid enough to get caught, and then he'd have his breakfast.

He was pleased with himself for improving his survival prospects this day as he climbed into the tree hollow and pushed debris to close off the entrance. Tomorrow looked to be a good day.

* * *

In the morning, Leutfrid was relieved to find the bird still in a good enough shape to animate. After another day or two, it would be too far gone to make use of. Also, he found that, while certainly not an expert at making it fly, he could do so for longer and longer periods of times. Also, his link to it was better established, likely because if anything it was now even more dead than before. He could now see more clearly through its eyes. He used the higher vantage point to his advantage and forage for food.

A short distance away, the bird saw some berries that were just now coming into ripeness. He was glad that he had learned wilderness lore when he was younger, for it served him well now. He identified this as mardlin berries, and he knew them to be delicious.

As he physically made his way to the bird's find, or was it his find? The bird was dead, and so at this point technically an extension of his own will. Leutfrid was not completely certain where he ended and the bird began.

And that was part of the problem, he mused to himself. This was the primary objection that caused proper societies, like the Tlakkan society, to not just look down on buy actively outlaw and try to stamp out voidmages. When he animated a creature, a small part of him became the creature. If the legends and stories of the voidmages of old were to be believed, such connections would eventually lead to madness.

Was he headed for madness? He did not think so. But what sort of future did he have? Certainly, he could stay here in these woods for a time, but he was no ranger or hunter.

Hunter. He thought of Leubast, and while she was not his friend, he knew that she was just doing her job. He wished her no specific harm. How had her encounter with the bandits turned out? She seemed able enough, but they outnumbered her. He hoped that they had not killed her, or worse.

Leutfrid shook his head to clear it of those thoughts. He had to focus on the now, on today. Today he was getting some mardlin berries. And he needed a better shelter, but he needed the energy to assemble it. Already he was mentally taxed by animating the bird, and soon he would not have the energy to do that.

He arrived at the berry bushes, and ate his fill. He did not have any sort of basket or pouches. Indeed he only had the tunic on his back and a pair of breeches. He went barefoot in the traditional manner of the Tlakkans. He took the tunic off, and used it to bundle as many berries as he could. He would have made his base of operations nearby, but he knew that he was not the only interested party in them, and that some of those interested parties might also be interested in him as a food source.

He set the bird aflight again, now to scout for a good location in which to build a lean-to. His poor accomodations of the last night he afforded him little sleep, and he had noticed the tracks of a few smaller predators investigating the smell of a newcomer. They were wary last night, but would become braver with repeated encounters.

Leutfrid was surprised to learn that there was a farm nearby. Immediately his hopes were raised, at least until he gave it some actual thought. He could not contact them, for even if Leubast had been horribly murdered by those bandits, he was certain that if the bounty on his capture were not already known to them, it would be before long. No, he could not be safe anywhere in civilized lands.

Or at least, not any of the civilized lands this close to Tlak. He pondered for a moment a journey to the south, in which the Ylf land of Aeborodor lies. But even the thought of that soured. Ylfs were lovers of light and life, and he doubted that even they would suffer a Tlakkan voidmage.

So he was stuck. He could not escape to a far away land, nor could he rejoin society. He could struggle to survive in the wilderness, but that would eventually kill him as he was no expert. He was a dead Tlakkan, though he yet walked, for now.

Through the eyes of the bird, he saw a feathered creature shimmy up a tree, holding a dead chicken. Dead chicken? Leutfrid thought. This bears a closer look. He landed the bird near the creature and examined it. It was around his height, had a reptilian snout with sharp teeth, piercing eyes that faced forward, and powerful legs. Its forelimbs ended in hands with three claws each. One of its hands was holding the dead chicken. There were chicken feathers floating everywhere. Leutfrid wondered a moment why this creature had climbed this tree so suddenly.

Then he hear them. Several of the farm hands were after it, forks and hoes in hand. One on one, this creature looked like it could best any one of these men, even with tool in hand. However, outnumbered like this, it was only a matter of time.

Leutfrid realized that the creature had taken notice of his zombie bird. It was sniffing the air, examining his thrall. He found this unsettling, and realized that this creature was no mere animal. It had intelligence.  It, like him, was being hunted. Leutfrid decided that he needed to render aid to this creature.

He controlled the bird to dive at the farmers. They were perplexed, and waved their implements to ward him off ineffectively. At first, the feathered creature just stayed where it was, but quickly it realized it was being given a break, and it jumped to the next tree and soon was gone.  Leutfrid pestered the farmers for several minutes, until they retreated back towards the farm, mumbling to themselves about strange goings on. He had the zombie bird follow them a ways until he was certain that they had abandoned pursuit, then he went back to seach for the creature.

It took some time to find it, and the dead chicken was gone, Leutfrid presumed eaten in a hurry. This creature was no dummy! He landed the bird nearby, and observed the creature slowly approach and study it. It did not attack, it just watched his zombie curiously. After a short while, he summoned the bird back to him, doing his best to memorize land marks so that he could find his new friend later, presuming that the creature dwelt nearby. In any case, there was foraging to do.

Over the course of the next hour or so, he found some edible mushrooms. Tlakkans of all walks of life had always been enamored of mushrooms, and Leutfrid was no different. As a result, this was a part of foraging that he actually had some level of mastery of. He also found some tree nuts relatively nearby. Defore long, his local supply would be diminished, but he decided to worry about tomorrow when it actually was tomorrow.

With grim and wholly unskilled determination, he set about trying to build a lean-to. Quickly he realized that he had no idea how to make cordage, and contented himself to strip bark off of young branches instead. It was wet and slick and made a mess of his hands, but he knew he needed shelter.

He found thicker fallen branches here and there, but not nearly enough to construct any sort of shelter. In addition, he had no way of cutting the branches to length, and nor did he have any idea of how to fashion a tool that would let him cut the branches.

Eventually, he gave up, with only a small pile of branches and strips of tree bark to show for his efforts. His hands hurt and his curly hair was sweaty and matted to his brown. It was mid afternoon when he decided that shelter was a lost cause, and he was resigned to tucking himself into his previous nights cold, exposed location.

He considered for a moment waiting for nightfall and looking for tools and other supplies to build with from the farmers. He would have to be judicious about it, and only take small quantities, but he was desperate. But then he realized that it would not be a good idea to go to the farm tonight. Their experience with the creature would have them alerted to a nearby predator, and so he would need to wait until tomorrow night. He hoped it would not rain.

He found some pebbles in a nearby creek bed. He would have fished had he a pole, and this reminded him of his utter failure at outdoorsmanship. He had always thought that he lived a simple rustic life, but even being reared in a village of modest and hardworking Tlakkans had shielded him from the the rigors of having to survive with nothing by hit wits.

With the pebbles, he had a go at throwing them at birds. Nuts and mushrooms and berries were all well and good, and he was grateful to have found them, but meat would have to be on the menu at some point. Tlakkans were not vegetarians.

As a child, he was well practiced with hitting targets with rocks, but that had been at play, and never at something alive and moving. He missed most of the time, with whichever bird he was targeting moving away in just the nick of time. But eventually one did land, though it did not strike any vital part of the bird, and it flew away, alarmed.  But he was encouraged, and his skill was improving.

Eventually he managed to strike one in the head, and it fell to the ground. Acting quickly, for he knew not whether he had actually killed it or just stunned it, he found where it was and finished the job by smashing its head in with a rock. He was exuberant! He had hunted himself dinner.

Reality stopped him. He had no way of making fire: no matches, no tinder box. And he knew to eat the bird raw would most likely make him sick. Disheartened, he considered throwing the bird into the creek.

Then he realized that voidmagic, if applied creatively, might allow him to start a fire. He knew nothing of actual pyromagic, but he did know that very dry pieces of wood when rubbed together could catch fire. And while drying something would be within the realm of hydromagic or aeromagic, his command over death and dying could have much the same effect.

He started with some leaves. Speaking some words and concentrating caused them to go from green to withered to a dried-out brown. He did the same to a few flatish pieces of wood, and as much to most of his failed lean-to supply pile. He could force all of the wood to drain of its life essence, and, he realized, he took it for himself.

This, of course, was another reason that voidmagic was so frowned upon. He was literally stealing the life of other beings. Certainly, in this case it was just plants, but doing so from plants, or people, would be evil and cruel. *And also drive me mad as well*, he mused.

He took a flat piece of dried out wood, and put a clump of dried leaves on top of it. He then took a second flat piece, layering the leaves between them, and he moved the top piece back and forth while keeping the bottom piece in place with his knee. Before too long, he saw smoke, and brough the ember to his dried pile and blew on it. He had made a fire without pyromagic!

He constructed a primitive spit, plucked the bird and roasted it over the fire. It was burned more than a bit, and not delicious in the slightest, but it was food. 

It grew colder as dusk approached, so he buried himself as best he could in leaves and found another night of fitful sleep.
