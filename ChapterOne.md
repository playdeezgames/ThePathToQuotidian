# Scene I

Runt of the Tribe, for such was his designator and served approximately the same purpose as a name in human society, continued to run as quickly as he could down the tunnel. His heart beat rapidly and felt ready to give out at any time. The wounds on his leg and tail still bled, matting down his feathers, but he dared not stop, for the Enemies pursued him to finish their job of killing him and feast on his flesh. Ahead of him, he saw a light, and he pushed his aching muscles to go even faster. He burst into the bright noonday sunlight and kept running. He squinted as his eyes adjusted to the bright exterior lights, attempting to figure out where in the Bog he was. But he was not in the Bog, it seemed, or at least, not in any part of the Bog that he was familiar with. The air was drier here, the land firmer and covered in grass. Nearby he spotted a hedge that he could hide in. He quickly turned his head to glance back at the tunnel he had exited. His pursuers had not emerged. That was a stroke of luck.

He sprinted to the hedge and crouched low to the ground, continuing to fiercely watch for his Enemies, but allowing his body to rest, to breathe. The Enemy still did not emerge, so Runt of Tribe waited. His heart calmed, as did his breathing. Maybe they had gotten lost? *That’s impossible*, thought Runt, *The tunnel is completely straight, with no turns or twists or branches.* He waited patiently, but eventually his leg and tail wounds pained him enough to take his attention away from the tunnel’s entrance.

He licked his wounds with his forked tongue, still momentarily glancing back to where he expected the Enemies to show up at any moment. The coppery taste of the blood reminded him that he still had not managed to eat today, though he was glad that he had not yet become someone else’s meal. At least, not yet. A few moments later, his wounds were cleaned. None of them were life threatening, and his various scars, though hidden under his feathers, bore testimony to the fact that he had suffered worse before. Eventually his exhaustion got the better of him, and he fell unconscious.

He awoke with a start. The sun had moved. He had not meant to sleep at all. Still hidden in the bush, he checked the area. Had the enemy found him, they would have killed and eaten him, so they had forgotten him or found something else to hunt. Runt did not care, because he lived still. But he was still hungry, and now even more ravenously. His flight had depleted his energy reserves, and he would need to eat soon or be in real trouble. Still not willing to depart from his safe hiding spot, he looked between the leaves and branches at the region around him, and was immediately reminded that he was no longer in the Bog, where he might have easily found puddles filled with Prey.

He cocked his head to the side, listening intently for tell tale signs of Prey, in whatever form it might be here. He could not afford to be picky today. Within moments, he heard birdsong, and that singer of that song landed on the grass near his hiding place, foraging for bugs and worms.

*Prey!* he thought. He tensed his muscles, readying for a pounce. But before he could do so, the bird, with a fat earthworm in its beak, jumped up and flew towards a nearby wooded area. While disappointed that his meal was delayed, Runt knew that this meant something important: this bird had a nest nearby, and that nest had  fledgling in it - a nice juicy fledgeling.

He got onto his three toed-feet quietly, always on the alert for danger. He quickly ran into the wooded area he had seen the bird fly into. Finding another stealthy hiding spot, he listened some more. His mouth salivated at the thought of tearing open the fledgeling with his fangs and passing it mostly whole into his gullet. That would be a mighty fine meal indeed. But for now, he listened and waited. His patience, he was certain, would be rewarded.

The wait felt like forever, though it was only a few moments, and he heard a rustle up a nearby tree. He scanned the high branches with his keen eyes. The nest was there, but so was the mother. He would have to wait until she left before proceeding. Another subjective eternity later, she departed, and he sprang into action. Most of Runt's kind made very poor climbers, but that was mostly due to the fact that they were usually at least half again as big as him, but also they were unpractised. Most of Tribe did not need to climb trees to get food, because it was plentiful enough in Bog to not need to see up high. Runt had occasionally used his climbing ability to find food, but he more often used to to avoid becoming food.  He numbling dug his forearm and foot claws into the bark of the tree and shimmed up quickly, but quietly, to the level of the nest. As expected, the fledgling was there. Correction, there were two fledglings. He wanted to know which of them were more delicious, and planned to find out.

Suddenly he heard a screeching sound, and before he could turn to look for its origin, the mother bird had attacked his head, leaving a scratch near his eye. Now he could see his attacker, and he saw that it was not the mother bird. This bird had brighter plumage and was bigger. The father, then. He had picked a type of bird where both parents participated in the raising of their young.  Momentarily, another screech as the mother had been alerted and returned to the nest area, and he fended them off as best he could, but it was clear that the fledgelings would not be on the menu this afternoon. The parent birds did not stop pestering him until he had put a safe distance between himself and the tree. 

He backed away slowly, longingly looking back to the tree holding a delicious meal that he was being denied. His hunger burned more fiercely in his belly. He was getting desperate. He stumbled backwards and found himself having fallen across a small stream. It was only ankle deep, and not so wide that he could not jump over it with a short run. But streams meant fish, and fish meant food, so Runt found his way upstream to where the water flowed more slowly and shallowly, and stood over the water, waiting for fish to wander by unaware.

Fish did come, of course, but they were both too fast and too small for him to catch. He caught a few morsels, and gobbled their meagre offering greedily. They were no fat fledglings, but he could not be choosy at this point.

As the shadows were getting long as the sun set, he finally allowed practicality to enter into his food solutions. As a whole, he did not care for worms and grubs, but it was not the first time he had need of making use of this food resource in his life, and he figured it woult unlikely be his last if his luck did not change. He found several rocks and fallen logs to look under, and made a modest wriggling meal of the slimy, squishy creatures he found beneath it. At least he wouldn't starve, but tonight he would not sleep with a full belly, either.

The sun was getting low, and he had shelter to consider. He briefly thought about the tunnel he had run through, but discarded the idea immediately. He had not revisited that area since entering the woods. The Enemies might have finally arrived, or be lurking within. He also rejected the idea of spending the night in a tree, lest any other birds find him an intruder and attack him. He set out desperately looking for a place in which to sleep. It was getting dark.

Fortunately, he soon found a dying tree with a hollow in its trunk large enough for him to squeeze into. Wisely, he first picked up a long stick to poke into it in order to check if this tree already had a resident. To his relieve it did not. He slid into the hollow, scratching out some of the interior to shove against the inlet to his cozy space. It was not comfortable, but in the morning he would find something to pad the inside.

In the darkness, with the unfamiliar night insects buzzing their song, and hungry and cold Runt slept in the hollow of the tree, safe for the moment. He had lived another day. But would he survive tomorrow?
