# Scene I

Runt of the Tribe, for such was his designator and served approximately the same purpose as a name in human society, continued to run as quickly as he could down the tunnel. His heart beat rapidly and felt ready to give out at any time. The wounds on his leg and tail still bled, matting down his feathers, but he could not stop, for the Enemies pursued him to finish the job and feast on his flesh. Ahead of him, he saw a light, and he pushed his aching muscles to go even faster. He burst into the bright noonday sunlight, and kept running. He squinted as his eyes adjusted to the bright exterior lights, attempting to figure out where in the Bog he was. But he was not in the Bog, it seemed, or at least, not in any part of the Bog that he was familiar with. The air was drier here, the land firmer and covered in grass. Nearby he spotted a hedge that he could hide in. He quickly turned his head to glance back at the tunnel he had exited. His pursuers had not emerged. That was a stroke of luck.

He sprinted to the hedge and crouched low to the ground, continuing to fiercely watch for his Enemies, but allowing his body to rest, to breathe. The Enemy still did not emerge, so Runt of Tribe waited. His heart calmed, as did his breathing. Maybe they had gotten lost? *That’s impossible*, thought Runt, *The tunnel is completely straight, with no turns or twists or branches.* He waited patiently, but eventually the pain in his leg and tail wounds pained him enough to take his attention away from the tunnel’s entrance.

He licked his wounds with his forked tongue, still momentarily glancing back to where he expected the Enemies to show up at any moment. The coppery taste of the blood reminded him that he still had not managed to eat today, though he was glad that he had not yet become someone else’s meal. At least, not yet. A few moments later, his wounds were cleaned. None of them were life threatening, and his various scars, though hidden under his feathers, bore testimony to the fact that he had suffered worse before. Eventually his exhaustion got the better of him, and he fell unconscious.

He awoke with a start. The sun had moved. He had not meant to sleep at all. Still hidden in the bush, he checked the area. Had the enemy found him, they would have killed and eaten him, so they had forgotten him or found something else to hunt. Runt did not care, because he lived still. But he was still hungry, and now even more ravenously. His flight had depleted his energy reserves, and he would need to eat soon or be in real trouble. Still not willing to depart from his safe hiding spot, he looked between the leaves and branches at the region around him, and was immediately reminded that he was no longer in the Bog, where he might have easily found puddles filled with Prey.

He cocked his head to the side, listening intently for tell tale signs of Prey, in whatever form it might be here. He could not afford to be picky today. Within moments, he heard birdsong, and that singer of that song landed on the grass near his hiding place, foraging for bugs and worms.
